Mechanical 1 (M1)	(Board outline) Board outline (it is not recommended to use just the keep-out layer, since that can be used for other things also).
Mechanical 2 (M2)	(PCB notes in Gerber) PCB notes and comments for the PCB manufacturer/assembler (included in Gerber output).
Mechanical 3 (M3)	(PCB notes not in Gerber) General notes and comments that the PCB manufacturer/assembler does not need to know about (not included in Gerber output).
Mechanical 11 (M11)	(Top dimensions) Top layer dimensions (paired with M12).
Mechanical 12 (M12)	(Bottom dimensions) Bottom layer dimensions (paired with M11).
Mechanical 13 (M13)	(3D body and mechanical outlines) Top layer component body information (3D models and mechanical outlines, paired with M14).
Mechanical 14 (M14)	(Bottom 3D body and mechanical outlines) Bottom layer component body information (3D models and mechanical outlines, paired with M13).
Mechanical 15 (M15)	(Assembly) Top layer courtyard and assembly information (paired with M16). This normally includes a cross-hairs at the origin of the component.
Mechanical 16 (M16)	(Assembly) Bottom layer courtyard and assembly information (paired with M15). This normally includes a cross-hairs at the origin of the component.
