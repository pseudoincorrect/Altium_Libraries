How to add a part to any library:
- We want to add this part (LM2775DSGR from Texas Instrument) to our Chips library : https://www.digikey.co.uk/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/LM2775DSGR/296-46107-2-ND/5438061
- We get the (LM2775DSGR Part from Ultralibrarian, then import it to altium
- In Altium we get an integrated library for this part
- We do NOT copy paste these parts directly (PCB or SCH) in the library <========== Most important part of this guide
- Why ? We want to select enter the necessary data in the SCH library and want that the layer in PCB are unified (all companies have different set of layers that would mess up badly with our design if we do not unify them)
- In Our library, we will assume now that we are adding a part to our Chips library
- Go on the SCH library panel
- In the Schematic part of the Chips library copy paste the template
- Open the new template copy 
- In Design Item ID we fill with the name of the part: LM2775DSGR
- In Description copy past the short description from digikey
- In Parameter fill all the empty parameter (manufacturer part number, price, link, ...)
- From the UltraLibrarian LM2775DSGR SCH part copy all the PIN 
- In our LM2775DSGR SCH libary (that we renamed to LM2775DSGR) we paste these pin and adapte the rectangle shape around it
- From the UltraLibrarian LM2775DSGR PCB part copy all the PAD
- Similarily, in our LM2775DSGR PCB library we paste these pin and adapte the silkscreen (yellow) and mecaniacal (green) shapes around it
- Back to our SCH libary, in Model, Add Footprint, navigate to the LM2775DSGR PCB part, then check the Pin and Pad are correctly aassigned
- In project explorer right click on Chips library, compile it
- Done
